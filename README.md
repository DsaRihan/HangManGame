# Hangman Game in Python

## Description

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project implements a simple version of the Hangman game in Python.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Displays the current state of the word with correctly guessed letters.
- Allows the player to guess letters until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.
- Provides feedback on the player's guesses.

## Requirements

This project requires Python to be installed on your machine. The `random` library is used to select a word randomly from the list. This library is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is necessary.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. No additional libraries need to be installed since `random` is part of the standard library.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Hangman game script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
