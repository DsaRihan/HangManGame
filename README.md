Description

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project implements a simple version of the Hangman game in Python.

Features

Displays the current state of the word with correctly guessed letters.
Allows the player to guess letters until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.
Provides feedback on the player's guesses.
Requirements

This project requires Python to be installed on your machine. The random library is used to select a word randomly from the list. This library is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is necessary.

Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.
No additional libraries need to be installed since random is part of the standard library.
